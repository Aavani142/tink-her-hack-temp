## Project Description

SignBridge is a real-time AI-powered communication system that bridges the gap between sign language users and non-sign-language users.

It enables seamless two-way interaction by converting hand gestures into text and generating sign language through a 3D avatar from text input.

This makes communication easier, faster, and more inclusive in everyday environments.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Deaf and mute individuals face major communication barriers in public spaces because most people do not understand sign language.  
Existing solutions are expensive, hardware-heavy, or not practical for real-time everyday communication.

This creates social isolation and limits accessibility.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

SignBridge provides a two-way communication bridge:

### ✋ Sign ➜ Text
Camera detects hand gestures and converts them into readable text in real time.

### 💬 Text ➜ Sign
User enters text and a 3D avatar performs sign language visually.

This allows smooth communication between both groups without needing interpreters or special devices.
